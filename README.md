# Zoom Transcript Filter

A friend of mine needs to use transcripts from Zoom meetings for documenting purposes or writing articles.

When there is a pause in speaking, the transcript starts a new text block. What she wanted was something that:
1. Makes a single text block for each speaker until the next person speaks
1. Remove the timestamps as for her, they were noise

The script `zoom_transcript_filter` does the above. It's a bash script because her machine didn't have a recent version of Python or Ruby on it. And because she and her colleagues aren't regular command line users, I dropped the file extension.

I'll add some instructions on how to use it here soon.
